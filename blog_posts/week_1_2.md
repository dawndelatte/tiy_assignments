#TIY (all the things...and feelings)

##Week One

###Floating _(Left)_ in a Sea of Unfamiliarity

The day is finally here! I have started my journey at The Iron Yard. After months of wavering between feelings of excitment and slight terror, I jumped in ... sort of blindly. I had already attended a week of the Front End Engineering class, so I felt like I had a good "practice round" in. But nothing really prepared me for the sheer amount of information and exercise my brain was getting. 

Many of my classmates and fellow iron yarders were so willing to share their experiences and insights. I found myself learning a lot more than **HTML** and **CSS**. I was (and still am) trying to learn about myself and how I work and what kind of attitudes hold me back or help me to move forward.  I am learning to trust. To trust my instructors, my peers, and myself. 

The first week was overwhelming, but not in the way that I expected. I was overwhelmed with feelings of self-doubt and anxiety, and that was matched by encouragment from Sam and the other Iron Yard team leaders. This is a community of people who were in the same _sea_, on their own boats. 

I never considered myself a great student in college. So I felt like this was my second chance. This was a challenge though when I began to feel inadequite because the ever illusive "click" was not happening. I know, I know, nothing's going to click in the first week, but quieting those thoughts are a lot harder for me. The more I worked, and the further we got in class, the more I realized that the clicking was there, but it came in what I like to call a "gentle whisper".

Week One left me ~~feeling~~ knowing that I was, in fact, in the right place and had made the right decision to leave it all behind, and join The Iron Yard in song and pun into a _whole new world_.


##Week Two

###On _Middle_ Ground 

I'm starting to feel like I get it.. sort of.. I think. There are no big lows, thank goodness, and no big highs, besides still being here. 

We were assigned a video to watch in our weekend homework that really put some things into perspective. [It's Dangerous to go Alone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1i8ylq4j_EY) talks about _Imposter Syndrome_ and ways to help yourself or your coworkers overcome some of the hurdles people with insecurities about their skills face (eg. _me_).

My mind is in a continual state of **blown**. I'm starting to feel like myself, except that there's this weird state you get in when you code for too long without a break called HYSTERIA. That's where the singing happens, and puns happen (get it -- git it?), and it's also where your mind shuts down and everything you know to be true is not working.

That's when you need a break, sun shine and/or food. It's amazing the amount of time you can spend on one itty bitty problem only to take a quick shower and discover mid-rinse that you put the right information in THE WRONG PLACE!

Lesson learned, Week Two, lesson learned.
