Established in 1840, Antoine’s is the country’s oldest family-run restaurant, a favorite of locals, and a beloved New Orleans institution.

In 2015, Antoine’s Restaurant turns 175 years old! Obviously they have been doing something right throughout the years to have lasted long enough to be considered the oldest continuously operated family-run restaurant in the country. Throughout the years Antoine’s remained iconic and famous for great service, atmosphere, culinary delights and New Orleans originals – like Oyster Rockefeller, Eggs Sardou, and the famous puffed soufflé potatoes -that were all born here. Guests have included famous movie stars, musicians, presidents, popes, generals, and New Orleans’ most prominent families.

The names of each of the dining rooms at Antoine’s Restaurant are steeped in history. During the French Quarter Festival Opening Night Gala, enjoy the original Main Dining Room, the Mardi-Gras themed Rex, Proteus, and 12th Night Revelers rooms, the Mystery Room, 1840 Room, the Last Room (or Tabasco Room) and the Wine Cellar, which holds approximately 25,000 bottles when fully stocked. French Quarter Festival is the only time of the year when Antoine’s allows a non-profit community organization to ‘take over’ – celebrating the opening of French Quarter Festival at this grand Gala event.

Guests will enjoy tastings by Antoine’s and other festival favorites, and open bar courtesy of Abita Brewing Company and Republic Beverages.
