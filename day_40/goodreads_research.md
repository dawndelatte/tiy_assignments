## What are people saying about GoodReads?

“I am a reader. I've used other sites for logging books but none compare to Goodresds. It's very easy to use and I LOVE that I can use the app to scan the ISBN number with my smart phone. It pulls up everything from the cover to the description. Even the price and reviews. ”

“this app needs some work but it fulfills the function of providing a reading community as well as a way of storing info on your books and reading reviews.”

“What a great way to keep track of what books you have read while providing helpful reviews at the same time. As a voracious reader, I'm always looking for great recommendations and read alike suggestion. Now to get the hundreds of books I've read added.”

“This is a really great app. It worked well, but some things it didn't explain. For example, how do you join a group? It was a really good app but it didn't really tell you how to do things”

“Recommendation by friends is really important. Its a great social media place to keep track of your friends, see what they are reading and they rated their books as well as what they recommend. I loved that I can be connected to the authors to see what else they have written, so to there websites and just browse.”

## GoodReads vs Competitors


[Shelfari](http://www.shelfari.com/)— "Tour" right when you enter site, sign in with Amazon, not nearly as many features as Good Reads.

[anobii](http://www.anobii.com/)—Contemporary design, prominent search bar, simple and straightforward (big buttons), less sharing and community.

[weread](http://www.flipkart.com/books)—Categorizes well, In focus, "card" layout.

[Library Thing](https://www.librarything.com/)— **Testimonials** from NPR, NYTimes, and other serious book review resources, books available in many different languages, message boards.

## S.W.O.T.

####Current Strengths: 

Loyal fan-base, great social networking tool, has many features which allows for more personalization, great mobile app that allows organizing, changin status', and adding on the go, also a great resource for Authors connecting to their readers. 

####Current Weaknesses: 

Web app is very cluttered, hard to read and navigate, hardly any hierarchy, need auto fill/suggestions when searching. 

####Future Opportunities: 

Connecting to ebooks, becoming an actual book library so that you don't have to manual track all progress. 

####Future Threats: 

Design is outdated and as more competitors add features AND use current design "standards", it will be harder to stay on top. Amazon still owns several other social book library apps.
