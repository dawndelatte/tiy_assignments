##Possible Problems and S.W.O.T Analysis

In its current state, this webiste is difficult to navigate and is lacking in a "system" that would create more ease for festival attendees, especially people unfamiliar with the city. Based on competitor research, the site and brand feel outdated and do not represent the pride and culture that people associate with this city and event. Because this is such a large event and brings so much tourism to New Orleans, it would benefit from having a unique brand and webiste, seperate from the non-profit "umbrella" it is currently in. 

###Current Strengths
