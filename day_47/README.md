#French Quarter Festival Redesign Proposal
###Dawn Delatte

##Brand

French Quarter Festivals, Inc is a non-profit organization who's goal has always been to contribute to the economy of the French Quarter, by providing free entertainment for locals and tourists to explore the city. The French Quarter Festival started in 1984 as a "showcase" for New Orleans’ finest local musicians. Since then, it has grown into the cities second largest festival, which represents the best of local culture, food, music, film, and visual art. This festival truly embodies the unique and diverse culture of the French Quarter in New Orleans and provides an amazing opportunity to support local artists and keep communities and the world connected to this city. 

####What are people saying about The French Quarter Festival?

“Promoters of the French Quarter Festival have taken to calling it 'The World’s Largest Block Party!'” —New Orleans Online

“What started as a neighborhood festival and “locals' event” has grown into the largest showcase of Louisiana music and food in the world, with an economic impact of over $251 million. Last year, Huffington Post named French Quarter Festival the “one thing to do in Louisiana.” —Biz New Orleans
 

##Audience

Although this festival's audience in the past has been more focused on adults, in recent years it has become a festival that welcomes all members of the family—from small children to teenagers and millennials. The website is for festival goers—locals and tourists who need to easily navigate the stage schedules, locations/maps and get important information about places to stay, nearby restaurants, and special events times and locations.

##Possible Problems and S.W.O.T Analysis

In its current state, this website is difficult to navigate and is lacking in a "system" that would create more ease for festival attendees, especially people unfamiliar with the city. Based on competitor research, the site and brand feel outdated and do not represent the pride and culture that people associate with this city and event. Because this is such a large event and brings so much tourism to New Orleans, it would benefit from having a unique brand and website, separate from the non-profit "umbrella" it is currently in.

###Current Strengths

* loyal attendees
* national recognition
* support from local businesses
* free and open atmosphere 
* artist focused
* family friendly

###Current Weaknesses

* poor branding/promotion
* poor navigation on site, including maps
* not responsive/mobile friendly
* more emphasis on local sponsors

###Future Opportunities 

* stronger branding 
* mobile friendly
* local and national press
* food and stay maps and recommendations
* more stroller and wheelchair accessibility 

###Future Threats

* loss of attendees due to crowding (need to keep local vibe)
* loss of visitors to the site because of navigation issues and lack of mobile friendliness


##Possible Solutions and Game Plan

It's important that this website be accessible to multiple generations and locals and tourists alike; with a better organized site navigation and emphasis on event schedules and locations. Right now the homepage is cluttered with sponsor logos and could use some clear information on the festival and it's goals. It should also feel more contemporary, with an emphasis on New Orleans culture and heritage without looking "historical". Here are the 5 pages I would like to focus on:

* Home (landing page)
* Schedule (Music)
* Food (Vendors)
* Special Events (Parade, Gala, etc.)
* Festival Info (Maps and FAQs)

##Key Adjectives

* music
* free
* rhythm
* rich food
* unique
* eclectic 
* soul, funk, jazz
* vibrant
* multi-cultural
* multi-ethnic
* multi-generational
* family
* brass
* wrought iron
* second line
* marching band
* beats
* spring
* crawfish season
* stimulating
* all-ages
* appeals to every sense
